### Project Overview

 You are given references to news pages collected from an web aggregator in the period from 10-March-2014 to 10-August-2014. The resources are grouped into categories that represent pages discussing the same story. News categories included in this dataset include business(b); science and technology(t); entertainment(e); and health(h).

The goal is to predict which class a particular resource belongs to given the title of the resource.
